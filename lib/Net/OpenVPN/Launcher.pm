=head1 NAME

Net::OpenVPN::Launcher - start, stop and restart OpenVPN as a sub-process.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::OpenVPN::Launcher;

    my $pm = Net::OpenVPN::Launcher->new;

    $pm->start($filepath_to_config_file);

    # do some stuff

    # now stop the first instance of OpenVPN and start another
    $pm->start($filepath_to_alt_config_file);

    # do some stuff

    $pm->stop;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Net::OpenVPN::Launcher> is an object oriented module that provides methods to start, stop and restart OpenVPN. It's useful because it runs OpenVPN processes as a non-blocking sub-process. This allows you to start and stop several OpenVPN processes within the same Perl program. 


=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

=over

=item *

OpenVPN needs to be installed and in $PATH (or in bin, in $PATH). 

=item *

This module has been tested on OpenVPN version 2.2.1 - it should work with most versions of OpenVPN.

=item *

Currently only works with Linux-like operating systems.

=item *

By default OpenVPN needs to be run with root privileges, hence any Perl program using this module will need to be run as root unless OpenVPN has been configured to run under user privileges.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 start

Initialises OpenVPN with a config file. Requires a filepath to an OpenVPN config file. See the OpenVPN L<documentation|http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/427-openvpn-22.html> for example config files and options.

    $pm->start('openvpn.conf');

=cut

method start ($config_filepath) {
    # check that config filepath exists
    open( my $config, '<', $config_filepath );
    croak "config filepath $config_filepath not readable"
      unless -e $config_filepath;

    $self->config($config_filepath);

    # stop existing process
    $self->stop if $self->openvpn_pid;

    # run openvpn in child process
    my $pid = open my $fhOut, "| openvpn $config_filepath & ", or croak $!;
    $pid++;
    $self->openvpn_pid($pid);
    return 1;
}

=head2 restart

Restarts the existing OpenVPN process with the same configuration file as before.

    $pm->restart;

=cut

method restart {
    unless ($self->config && $self->openvpn_pid) {
        croak "Error: no running OpenVPN process found";
    }
    $self->start($self->config);
    return 1;
}

=head2 stop

Kills the OpenVPN process.

    $pm->stop;

=cut

method stop {
    if ( $self->openvpn_pid ) {
        # check if UID has permission to kill the openvpn process
        kill 0, $self->openvpn_pid
          ? kill 9, $self->openvpn_pid
          : croak 'Error: unable to kill the openvpn PID: '
          . $self->openvpn_pid;
    }
    else {
        croak 'Error: no PID found for openvpn process';
    }
    return 1;
}

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 DEMOLISH

This method is called on object destruction and it will call the stop method if any active openvpn processes are found. This means it is not necessary to call the stop method when exiting the program.

=cut

sub DEMOLISH {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->stop if $self->openvpn_pid;
}

=head2 config

This is a getter/setter method for the filepath to the OpenVPN configuration file.

=cut

has config => ( is  => 'rw' );

=head2 openvpn_pid

This is a getter/setter method for the PID of the openvpn process.

=cut

has openvpn_pid => (
    is  => 'rw',
    isa => sub {
        die "$_[0] is not a number" unless $_[0] =~ /[0-9]+/;
    },
);

1;
